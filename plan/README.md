# MCP Client Planning Documentation

This directory contains planning documents for our Model Context Protocol (MCP) client application built with Tauri v2 and React. These documents outline the architecture, implementation strategy, and technical details for building a full-featured MCP client that can spawn and manage MCP servers.

## Document Overview

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [plan.md](plan.md) | High-level project overview and implementation plan |
| [server_spawning.md](server_spawning.md) | Detailed implementation plan for the server spawning component |
| [supported_servers.md](supported_servers.md) | List of MCP servers to be supported and their requirements |
| [directory_structure.md](directory_structure.md) | Planned directory structure and code organization |

## Project Summary

We're building a desktop application that serves as both an MCP client and a server management tool. Key features include:

1. **Server Spawning**: Launch and manage MCP servers directly from the application
2. **Server Registry**: Maintain a catalog of available servers with configuration management
3. **MCP Client**: Connect to MCP servers and utilize their resources, tools, and prompts
4. **User Interface**: Provide intuitive UI for server management and MCP interactions

## Getting Started

To understand the project plan:

1. Begin with [plan.md](plan.md) for a high-level overview of the project
2. Review [server_spawning.md](server_spawning.md) for details on the core server spawning functionality
3. Consult [supported_servers.md](supported_servers.md) to understand the range of servers we'll support
4. Check [directory_structure.md](directory_structure.md) for code organization details

## Technical Approach

The application uses a layered architecture:

- **Frontend**: React application for user interface
- **Backend**: Tauri/Rust for system integration and process management
- **MCP Layer**: Protocol implementation for server communication

All components will be built with cross-platform compatibility, security, and extensibility in mind.

## Next Steps

After reviewing these planning documents, the next steps are:

1. Set up the project with the planned directory structure
2. Implement the core process management functionality
3. Build basic server configuration UI
4. Implement MCP client connectivity
5. Expand to support all planned servers and features

These planning documents will evolve as development progresses, with updates to reflect new insights and design decisions.
